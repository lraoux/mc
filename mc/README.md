# Minecraft Customizer

[live](http://afcojor.herokuapp.com)

##Description
Minecraft Customizer provides the means for users to upload their texture packs, download others' and mix and match the textures from those packs for use in-game.

Minecraft Customizer was made once before, it failed due to technical issues after gaining momentum with a large user base. It is being reapproached, and I'm proposing this site as the webapp in a multiplatform project in the works.
